   <h1> What i learned </h>
   <p>  (There is no picture for now) Things that i learned  was how the circut would connect 
   on the board inorder for the light to turn on or flash. Some times it wont turn on due to either 
   error in the placement or the defect of the device. Also certin placings can change if it works or not. 
   i learned alot kinda. </p>
   <p>  Some difficulties we had were the one with the button. We got the norma lights to work and even 
   got the wheels to move but we were unalbe to make the button turn on and off the lights. </p>
