    <p> one new thing i learned is to make a button to rick roll people and im pretty happy about it.</p>
    <p> I would say it is a programing langage even though its used for math you would program the computer to do a certian equation an perfrm certian task but a mark up language hs to do with the formating of the words and numbers</p>
