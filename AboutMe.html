    <h3> Reflections</h3>  
    <p> one new thing i learned is to make a button to rick roll people and im pretty happy about it.</p>
    <p> I would say it is a programing langage even though its used for math you would program the computer to do a certian equation an perfrm certian task but a mark up language hs to do with the formating of the words and numbers</p>                                             
    <p>i would like to add alot of things beacuse i didnt finish and im a sad potato</p>
    <p> what i dont understand are alot of things i didnt get far but im still working on it </p>
    <p> there are so many things i would love to add to my django web[age because i wanst completly finishedc i got it to work up till a point and it was going fine with alot of errors but i got pretty far and all i want for now from my django webpage is to complete it and make it pretty </p>
    <p>  i really dont know i think is how it is able to process it so fast and its magical</p>
    <p> A list can store a sequence of objects in a certain order such that you can index into the list, or iterate over the list. List is a mutable type meaning that lists can be modified after they have been created.
    <p> i am proud of everything because i actucally understand something </p>
    <p>  The algrithem that is most unique to me is the ray tracer beacuse it has to do with the preciption of the eyes. and some people are blind but idk" </p>
    <p>  I dont really know tyo to comapre the algorithem beacsue she wrote the first one but i guess there are more algrithems and newer and more advance </p>
A tuple is similar to a list except it is immutable. There is also a semantic difference between a list and a tuple. </p>
  <p> well it didnt work cuz some codes arent finished and it is a little shaky but im trying to get it to work.</p>
  <p> to insert a password and email maybe s security question </p>
