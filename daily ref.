   <h1> What i learned </h>
   <p>  (There is no picture for now) Things that i learned  was how the circut would connect 
   on the board inorder for the light to turn on or flash. Some times it wont turn on due to either 
   error in the placement or the defect of the device. Also certin placings can change if it works or not. 
   i learned alot kinda. </p>
   <p>  Some difficulties we had were the one with the button. We got the norma lights to work and even 
   got the wheels to move but we were unalbe to make the button turn on and off the lights. </p>
   <p>  I learned that it is more complex than i thought. all i knew is that you have to put in code inorder to make the 
   robot to perform certin functions but the complcity inside the robot and its sensing or how the information travles through 
   is really intresting. we were just struggling to get a light to turn on but dealing with a robot is going to much diffrent but i look 
   foward to it. plus robots are cool just imagin creating a super human or a robot that can do anything. (i watched to much sci-fi)</p>
   <p> i guess what worked well is that everyone is easy to talk to and they helped sort of but wehat we could do better is we should try and 
   focus on out tasks more due to us getting off task easily and directing out attention to something else but over all i think we worked 
   pretty well we just have to stay on task. Also we should prepare outselves more due to not really understanding anything and google was a big help</p>
   <p> in my ipinion my group worked pretty well together everyone was friendly and i learned sometimes the sencorses are spazy and rip oor disabled child </p>
